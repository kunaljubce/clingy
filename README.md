## Clingee (pronounced, clean-gee) - Your personal Gmail cleaner

### Are you tired of those thousands of social, promotional and spam mails flooding your inbox?
### Now that Google Photos is a part of your 15 GB Google Drive capacity, are you freaked out about cleaning up your mail box?
### Are you obsessed with sorting your mails into various labels, which become irrelevant over time?

### Worry no more! Pass on your tedious Gmail cleaning plans to Clean-G. Here's how it works:
- You install Clingee on your laptop/desktop and setup a one-time authentication to your Gmail id.
- You let it run some checks and tell you which all labels are there on your mail box and how many mails (unread/total) are there in each of them.
- You choose the labels and the types of mails to delete from each of them. Bingo! Clean-G does the rest and you have a perfectly clean mailbox.

### Steps to run the app
* Clone this repo using the command - `git clone https://github.com/kunaljubce/gmail-cleaner.git`.
* Once clone process has finished, navigate inside the directory using the command - `cd gmail-cleaner`.
* Generate the `credentials.json` file. This is an API key file that provides the application with the credentials to request access to your gmail. You can find the steps to generate this file [here](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#api-key).
* Once created, please download the file and move it to the current directory and save it as `credentials.json`.
