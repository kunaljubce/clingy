## Clean-G (pronounced, clean-gee) - Your personal Gmail cleaner

# Are you tired of those thousands of social, promotional and spam mails flooding your inbox?
# Now that Google Photos is a part of your 15 GB Google Drive capacity, are you freaked out about cleaning up your mail box?
# Are you obsessed with sorting your mails into various labels, which become irrelevant over time?

## Worry no more! Pass on your tedious Gmail cleaning plans to Clean-G. Here's how it works:
- You install Clean-G on your laptop/desktop and setup a one-time authentication to your Gmail id.
- You let it run some checks and tell you which all labels are there on your mail box and how many mails (unread/total) are there in each of them.
- You choose the labels and the types of mails to delete from each of them. Bingo! Clean-G does the rest and you have a perfectly clean mailbox.
